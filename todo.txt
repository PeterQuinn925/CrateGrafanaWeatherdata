plan to get pooltemp data into weewx
write a service to subscribe to the weather/pooltemp topic and push the latest data into a file - done

Update the weewx driver to look for this file and post the data into the right fields when it processes a loop
Use the SoilTemp1 field

Update the inside temp device to use MQTT and the same mechanism
